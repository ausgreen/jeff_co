### JEFFCO
This project is for exploring information about Jefferson county, Alabama.  
The place my wife and I live.

#### Why?
I want to learn how to find and exploit public facing data to learn more about 
my community and improve my data wrangling and visualization skills.

# Resources
###### The GIS data I have been using comes from:
- https://gisweb.birminghamal.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Essentials/Basemap/MapServer

Note: Funny thing about this source... After 6 PM, you cannot query it.  
    Government requirement???
###### Example Query to gisweb.birminghamal.gov

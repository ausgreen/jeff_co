## Freewrite Birmingham Gun violence

Recently I came across a dataset that was a compilation
of all the gun violence in the United states since ~2008.
The dataset is large and needs some stitching together, and
only needs a little bit of work to be usable for making useful
connections between variables related to gun violence.

I would really like to make connections that are relevant
to birmingham alabama.  This could be statewide, or 
restricted to Jefferson county.  It would probably be easier
to work statewide and get more detailed as I become more 
skilled.

What connections are there to gun violence.  What idenpendent
variables have an effect on rates of gun violence? 

What is the relationship between Education and gun violence?

Between School scores and gun violence? 

Between locational density of fast food restraunts and 
gun-violence?(This could be a good proxy estimatorâ€“
**terminology?**) 

Poverty and gun violence?

locational bank density and gun violence?

Housing prices and gun violence?

between race and gun violence?

What categories can these incidents be broken down into?
